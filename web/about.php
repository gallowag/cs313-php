	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<p>Hello! I'm a student at BYU-I studying computer science. I love to read, draw, listen to k-pop, and dance! While I am studying most of the time I am also volunteering as a dance instructor on campus teaching swing. I'm from Kent, Washington which is about a half-hour south of Seattle. I'm the oldest of five kids and I love my family to death. Just over a year ago, my family moved to Rexburg and I moved in with them to save money. Being neighbors with the temple has been a blessing in our lives.</p>
